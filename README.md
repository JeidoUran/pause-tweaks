## Small Warning
The code for this is not fantastic as I'm not primarily a JavaScript developer. Expect bugs. Also, while this should work with just about any system or module, etc, there are going to be exceptions. Mostly if they mess with the pause popup themselves. I can attempt to make fixes for any situations like this, but no promises on it.
